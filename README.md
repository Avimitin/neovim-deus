## Requirement

Neovim v0.5+

## Known issues

~~Theme doesn't take effect on the neovim with version: 
`NVIM v0.5.0-dev+1390-g988f88c24`~~

If your neovim have problems like the colorscheme looks like default, you 
can try to set termguicolors before setting the theme.

Example fix:

```vim
set termguicolors

let &t_8f = "\<Esc>[38;2;%lu;%lu;%lum"
let &t_8b = "\<Esc>[48;2;%lu;%lu;%lum"

set background=dark    " Setting dark mode
colorscheme deus
let g:deus_termcolors=256
```
