## Requirement

Neovim v0.5+

## Known issues

~~Theme doesn't take effect on the neovim with version: 
`NVIM v0.5.0-dev+1390-g988f88c24`~~

If you have problems like the colorscheme looks like default, you 
can try to set termguicolors before setting the theme.

```vim
set termguicolors

color deus
```
